**Problem addressed**

Traditional books are outdated. Students need more than just books to enhance their knowledge. Internet serves as the best platform to learn, but also it is not reliable for students. Some moderation is to be done for narrowing the contents for learning. And also to save search time for students.
    
**Approach to solve the problem**

- Image will be analysed and text will be extracted using OCR.
- The raw text then analysed using spacy to provide a summary.
- The summary helps the user to understand the context easily.
